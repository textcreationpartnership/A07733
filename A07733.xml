         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <item>2 The particular miracle of the healing of the Leper, and the ſeuerall points obſerued in it. pag. 5.</item>
               <item>3 A deſcription of the nature and qualitie of the Leproſie; and of the contagion, and difficulty of the curing thereof. pag. 6</item>
               <item>4 The Lepers faith in comming vnto Chriſt, &amp; in making a petition to be healed of him; comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding faith without diffidence in prayer. pag. 8</item>
               <item>5 The Lepers humility &amp; reuerence vnto Chriſt, in worſhipping him and falling downe before him; commending humilitie and reuerence in prayer. pag. 11</item>
               <item>6 The honor that the Leper giueth vnto Chriſt, ſtiling him with the name of a Lord, acknowledging him to be Lord God Almightie, the ſoueraine Lord of heauen and earth. pag. 17</item>
               <item>7 The forme of the Lepers petition (in ſaying <hi>Si vis, potes,</hi> if thou wilt, thou canſt make me cleane) cleared from imputation of diſtruſt and diffidence of Chriſts goodnes towards him. pag. 24</item>
               <item>8 The matter of the Lepers petition, in praying for the health of his body, ſhewing the lawfulneſſe of praying for temporall things, and how farre and in what ſort wee ought to pray for them. pag. 26</item>
               <item>9 The ground of the Lepers petition: which is, the acknowledgement of Chriſts will and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident aſſurance of his power, in ſaying, <hi>Si vis, potes,</hi> if thou wilt thou canſt. pag. 32</item>
               <item>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13214:5"/>10 Two propoſitions diduced from thence: the one, that the will of God is the prime and principall cauſe of Gods workes; the other, that the will of God is omnipotent able to doo whatſoeuer it will. Ibid. 5</item>
               <item>11 The former point proued in diuers caſes, both of election, reprobation, &amp;c. of all which the will of God is ſhewed to bee the firſt, immediate &amp; prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall cauſe. pag. 33</item>
               <item>12 That the will of God is alwayes iuſt, though many times ſecret and hid from vs; and that there is alwayes a iuſt reaſon though not a ſuperiour cauſe of it. pag. 36</item>
               <item>13 Againſt the hereſie of the Pelagians and ſome of the Papiſts, affirming election and reprobation to be of a preuiſion and foreknowledge in God, the one of faith and good workes, the other of infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and the abuſe of his grace. pag. 38</item>
               <item>14 Notwithſtanding, the will of God is not the ſole cauſe of moſt of his workes, and particularly of mans ſaluation: but the will of man worketh with the will of God in the accompliſhment therof. pag. 43</item>
               <item>15 Neither is the meere will of God the only cauſe or any cauſe of the damnation of the wicked, without the malice and wickednes proceeding from mans owne will. pag 47</item>
               <item>16 The difference of reprobation and damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or of negatiue and poſitiue reprobation: the one depending vpon the will of God only; the other hauing reſpect vnto the wickedneſſe of man. pag. 48</item>
               <item>17 The concluſion of the firſt point, together with the right vſe to be made of it. pag. 49</item>
               <item>18 The ſecond point, concerning the omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency of Gods will; that nothing is able to reſiſt or
<pb facs="tcp:13214:5"/>to hinder the fulfilling of it. pag. 51</item>
               <item>19 Of diuers manners whereby God willeth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things, although there bee but one will in h m properly and indeede: viz. his abſolute will, or the will of his good pleaſure, which is alwayes fulfilled. pag. 53</item>
               <item>20 Againſt the doctrine of vniuerſall grace, as it is held by ſome; as being not able to confiſt nor to ſtand with the abſolute will of God and the powerfull and effectuall working thereof. pag. 54</item>
               <item>21 The order of Chriſts healing the Leper, by his hand, and by his tongue, with diuers reaſons of both. pag. 56</item>
               <item>22 The firſt reaſon, why Chriſt vſeth his hand in healing the Leper; being able to haue healed him without touching him: viz. to ſhewe that he was not ſubiect to the law as others, but was Lord of it. pa. 57</item>
               <item>23 The ſecond reaſon, to ſhew that hee did not feare to take the infection, nor refuſe to do a work of pietie, vpon any niceneſſe and ſqueamiſhneſſe: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is ſhewed how farre charitie is to bee extended in times of infection. pag. 61</item>
               <item>24 The third reaſon, to ſhewe that hee eſteemed more of charity then of the ceremonies of the lawe, and that all things are to yeeld vnto pietie and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie. Wherein is ſhewed how far charitie is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in a time of famine. pag. 69</item>
               <item>25 The reaſons why Chriſt vſeth his tongue in healing the Leper, being able to haue healed him without ſpeaking. pag. 79</item>
               <item>26 The firſt reaſon, which was to manifeſt the miracle to haue beene done by him and no other: wherein is ſhewed the neceſſarie vſe of a more pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like life, with a compariſon betweene it, &amp; that which is priuate, occupied for the moſt part in ſpeculation. pag 79 80</item>
               <item>
                  <pb facs="tcp:13214:6"/>27 The ſecond reaſon, which was to heale him after a decent manner: not by dumb ſhewes or apiſh geſtures; but by an expreſſe ſignificant voice, ioyned with an outward ſigne or action: Againſt the practiſe of coniurers, iugglers, and all impoſtors. pag. 84</item>
               <item>28 The third reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which was to ſhew the vertue and power of his ſpeech, hauing as much vertue and efficacie in his words as in his workes. Wherein is ſhewed the mightie power and efficacy of Gods word. pag. 90</item>
               <item>29 The particular wordes which Chriſt vſeth in healing, viz. <hi>volo mundare;</hi> declaring his mercy and goodneſſe to the Leper with his willingnes and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines to heale him in ſaying <hi>volo,</hi> I will: and his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall operation and performance of it in ſaying, <hi>mu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dare,</hi> be thou cleane. pag 98</item>
               <item>30 The former ſhewed in being willing to help vs not only when we pray, but alſo before we pray: with the reaſon why God doth not ſomtimes grant our praiers, nor extend his mercy generally to al. pag. 99</item>
               <item>31 The latter ſhewed in the performance of his promiſes, &amp; in doing actually and really whatſoeuer he will haue done. Wherein is manifeſted the ſtabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie and certainty of Gods will and decree concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning election and reprobation, and all other things; being moſt immutable and inuiolable. pag. 104.</item>
               <item>32 Diuers myſteries ſignified in Chriſts touching the Leper, and in ſaying, <hi>volo, mundare,</hi> I will be thou cleane. pag, 112</item>
               <item>33 The cure inſuing hereupon, wrought by ſo ſmall meanes, viz. by the word of his mouth and by the touch of his hand only; ſhewing the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full power of Chriſt, able to doo ſo great things by ſo weake meanes. pag. 116</item>
               <item>34 That it is not in the ſtrength and vertue of the meanes, but in the might and power of Gods

            <p>Concerning the Leper that maketh ſuite vnto Chriſt,
<note place="margin">Luke 5.12</note> S. <hi>Luke</hi> reporting this hiſtory, ſaith that he was no ordinary Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, but a man <hi>ful of leproſie;</hi> of the nature quality, ſignes, ſymptoms, and effects of which diſeaſe I holde it needeleſſe to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe out of the art and rules of phyſick, being ſo copiouſly deſcribed in the holie Scriptures, as you may reade in the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen and foureteen Chapters of Leuiticus,
<note place="margin">Le. 13. &amp; 14</note> and in diuers other places; onely I note two things that are eſpecially obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of it, the one that it was contagious and infectious: the other that it was deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate and almoſt incurable. So conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious it was,
<note place="margin">Leuit. 13.46</note> that God prouided in the lawe of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that ſuch perſons as were infected herewith, ſhould liue apart from the ſociety and companie of others, and ſhoulde vveare a couering vppon their lips; and as anie paſſed by to giue war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vnto them by crying; <hi>I am vnclean, I am vncleane:</hi> and all to this end, that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers might not be infected by them, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:13214:12"/>that euen <hi>Vzziah</hi> the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, being ſmittten with the leproſie for medling preſumptuouſly with the Prieſts office,
<note place="margin">2. Chro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. 26 21</note> liued as a Leper in a houſe apart by himſelf, all the dayes of his life. 2. Chro. 26.21. And ſo hard and difficult was the cure, that when the king of Syria ſent <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aman</hi> the Leper to the king of Iſraell to bee healed of him:
<note place="margin">2. King. 5.7</note> 
               <hi>See (ſayth the king of Iſraell) how he ſeeks a quarrell againſt mee: am I God to giue life?</hi> ſignifying that it was not in the art and cunning of man, but onelie in the power of God to heale this diſeaſe. So that the diſeaſe beeing ſo contagious, and ſo incurable, the healing of it cannot but bee admirable, vvorthie of an <hi>Ecce, Beholde,</hi> and deſeruing moſt diligent heede and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vnto it. Yea not onely the cure, but euerie circumſtance in it, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markeable, and worthy of obſeruation, both in the Leper and in CHRIST, and in the vvhole courſe and proceeding of it.</p>
            <p>To begin firſt with the Leper, who is the Petitioner, our Euangeliſt here ſayth
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:13214:13"/>that he came vnto Chriſt, which was very ſtrange, for in regard of the law he ought not to haue come, &amp; in regard of his ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes he was not well able to come,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Non ad Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stum ambulan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do currimus ſed credendo, nec motu corporis ſed voluntate cordis accedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mut.

            <p>But did the Leper this, thinke you, in regard of himſelfe only? No verily; but in regarde of vs alſo, to teach vs whenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer wee put vp our petitions and praie vnto Chriſt,

<note place="margin">Heb. 4.16</note> and to finde grace at the hands of God.</hi> In which regard, wee reade that when the man in the Goſpell came vnto Chriſt to make entreaty for his ſonne that was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed with a diuell,
<note place="margin">Mar. 9.22</note> telling him in what ſort he was taken, and deſiring him after a doubtfull manner to put to his hand, and to helpe him if hee coulde, ſaying, <hi>Si quid potes, adiuva nos, if thou canſt do anie thing helpe vs, and haue compaſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> inſteade of helping him he returnes him an aunſwere much like vnto his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund:

            <p>Therefore, in that holy prayer which he hath commended vnto vs, Mat. 6; Hee doth teach vs in the beginning of it to cal

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:13214:31"/>and inclining the ſame, yet it is not the ſole and only cauſe, as if there were no other anſwere to be giuen of any thing, but only becauſe God would haue it to bee ſo; foraſmuch as there are alſo manie ſecond cauſes concurring with the firſt, by the mediation whereof, the will of God doth effect and bring euerie thing to paſſe. As for example, in the matter of our ſaluation, if a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion ſhould be asked, why God doth ſaue ſome men, is there nothing to be anſwered, but becauſe God would haue them to bee ſaued?

For what great charitie is it, ſayth the fame Father, for a man abounding vvith ſtore and plentie, as the Sea dooth with water, to giue ſo much to thoſe that are in diſtreſſe out of his ſtore, as a little cuppe or diſh woulde holde of the water that is taken out of the Sea.

<note place="margin">Col. 3.12</note> Col.</hi> 3. that is, not onely to be mercifull, but to put on mercie, that as we put on our cloaths and garments and weare them vpon vs, ſo alſo to put on mercy &amp; compaſſion as a garment,

            <p>The third cauſe why Chriſt touched this Leper, was to ſhew that hee eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med more of charity (as <hi>Pellican</hi> obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth) then hee did of all the preſcripts and cuſtoms of the law, to whoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand all things whatſoeuer are to yeeld and to become ſubiect.

            <p>The firſt reaſon wherof, I ſuppoſe with <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> to be this, that all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that was preſent might knowe that hee was healed by him that ſayde hee would heale him, or rather comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him to be healed, in ſaying, <hi>Volo, mundare,</hi> I wil, be thou clean. For had CHRIST healed him ſecretly without ſpeaking, among ſo great a multitude as was about him, how coulde anie haue diſcerned whether hee was healed by him or by ſome other. And therfore to the end that this might certainely bee knowen, he doth not onely vſe his hand in touching him, but his tongue alſo in ſpeaking and ſaying; <hi>Volo, mundare,</hi> I will be thou clean. So that our bleſſed Sauiour, who otherwiſe did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire

<note place="margin">Mat. 11.4</note> and to the ende that by his workes the world might beleeue in him; hee doth not onely worke great miracles but hee would alſo haue the miracles knowen to be done by himſelfe, and not by any other. Wherein is propounded vnto vs, a matter worthy of our conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>viz.</hi> how farre forth we are to deſire and ſeek after a priuate and a cloſe kind of life: which is to be determined and to be meaſurd by a due regard of Gods honour, the aduauncement wherof we ought carefully to ſeeke after; and o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The 2. reaſon why Chriſt vſeth his tong in healing this Leper, was to ſhew he would heale him after a decent and a ſeemely faſhion, not doing his mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles and his other workes, by dumbe ſhewes and apiſh geſtures, and by mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering and mumbling, as inchaunters and ſorcerers vſe to doe; but by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe and ſignificant voyce, ioyned with an outward ſigne or action, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying his wil and pleaſure for the doing of it. To which end it is obſerued, he ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome or neuer doth any miracle, but he vſeth his tongue and his ſpeech when hee doth it. So long as hee refuſed to heale the Caananite to make triall of hir faith.

Which it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry credible that our Sauiour Chriſt did, to diſcouer the vanitie, and to condemn the impiety of coniurers and forcerers, who will take vpon them to doe great matters by outwarde and viſible ſignes onelie, as characters, figures, framing of circles, hanging of amulets about the necke, and ſuch like trumperie; things which in nature haue no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er nor vertue to produce ſuch effectes: or if they doe vſe words, they are either ſuch as haue no ſignification with vs, or elſe ſuch as are ſuperſtitiouſly abuſed out of the Scripture, and mumbled vp after a ſtrange and ridiculous manner; beeing for the moſt part not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of them that vſe them, nor anie wayes employed to that end, to which God hath ordained &amp; appointed them; whereas our bleſſed Sauiour in dooing this great worke vpon the Leper, vſeth

I doe not deny but that there was great neede and vſe of miracles in former times, when as the Church was firſt to bee planted, to the end that men might repent and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue the Goſpell; but now the doctrine of the Goſpell beeing confirmed and

            <p>The third cauſe why our Sauiour v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth his tongue in healing the Leper, was to ſhewe the exceeding great pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and vertue that is in his ſpeech, and in his words, inſomuch that when hee woulde haue gone to the Centurions houſe to haue healed his ſeruant, the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:13214:54"/>Centurion deſired only his word for the doing of it: <hi>Dic verbu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tantùm,
<note place="margin">Mat. 8.9</note> ſay but the word onely, and my ſeruant ſhall be whole.</hi> Concerning the vertue &amp; pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of whoſe word, if we ſhall enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a view and conſideration, wee ſhall find it not like the words of other men, which are commonly vaine and idle; but full of waight and power, hauing as much vertue and efficacie in them as his workes haue.

<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Aug. ad Deogratias ep.</hi> 49</note> as Saint <hi>Auſten</hi> ſayes; ſo likewiſe, hee worketh in his ſpeech, working as mightily by his wordes, as by his deedes. When our Sauiour Chriſt taught &amp; preached vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the people, they were al amazed and wondred at the gracious wordes that came from him. Luke 4.
<note place="margin">Luke 4.22</note> When he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted with the Sadduces and the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, hee put them all to ſilence with his words, ſo as they durſt not meddle any more with him. Mat. 22.

            <p>The next thing wee are to ſpeake of is the effect and cure that inſued heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon; for the Euangeliſt ſayth, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this, immediatly his leproſie depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from him. If wee conſider the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe of the Leper; it was verie ſore vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him: for, Saint <hi>Luke</hi> ſayth, that <hi>he was a man ful of Leproſie;</hi>

As for example, if a man be naked and readie to ſtarue for want of meate, and one ſhould ſay very charitably vnto him: my good friend, I would wiſh thee to put on ſome warme cloathes and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide thee ſome good meate, and yet not ſupply his want with either of them what think you of this? Is his body the warmer or his belly the fuller, for theſe fayre words?

<pb n="118" facs="tcp:13214:68"/>if a Phyſician ſhould come vnto me being ſick, and take me by the hand, and feele my pulſe, and ſay very cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully vnto me, Sir be of good comfort, there is no daunger at all; I will heale you, I warrant you, miniſtring no phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke at all vnto me; ſurely theſe are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good words, but what? am I healed any whit the ſooner for all this? I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe not. And yet notwithſtanding, marke I pray you: Chriſt heere dooth but touch the Leper, and ſpeake two words only, <hi>Volo, I will,</hi> and <hi>mundare, be thou cleane,</hi> and the leproſie preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly departeth from him.

            <p>Secondly, hee dooth it as the ſame Doctor ſaith, to honour his creatures in vouchſafing to make them coworkers with himſelfe; that as he is the firſt and principall Agent in euery thing; ſo the creatures worke together with him as meanes and inſtruments to performe the will of the firſt agent: not that God hath anie neede of them for the effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of his workes; but to vouchſafe an honour vnto them, it being altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a matter of dignation and not of

            <p>Now followeth the charge which
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:13214:85"/>our Sauiour Chriſt giueth vnto him after his cure: See thou tell no man &amp;c. Which perhaps may ſeeme vnto ſome to be very ſtrange, and ſcarſe ſtanding with the rules of ciuilitie &amp; humanity, to receiue a benefit &amp; then to ſmoother it by concealing of it; whereas if a poore man receiue but an almes, the hand will moue to the head, the knee wil bend to the ground, and the tongue will bee ready to giue thankes and to be telling euery body of it. All which I confeſſe to bee true: but yet doe but conſider the manner of the charge, and the intent &amp; mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Chriſt in it, and you will not only cleere him of all imputation, but alſo highly approue, and commend his dealing in it. Firſt for the manner of the charge, Chriſt doth not forbid him to publiſh this miracle by way of a precept as <hi>Caietan</hi> ſaies,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Caietan. in</hi> 8. <hi>cap. Mat.</hi>
               </note> but by way of an humble affection that he would ſhewe in himſelfe and commend vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tovs; or if it be a precept, yet it is not
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:13214:86"/>a ſimple or an abſolute precept, but a precept <hi>ſecundum quid,</hi> as the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſpeak, with relation to ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular reſpect: wherein hee doth not ſimply and abſolutely commaund him to tell no man, as if he would haue had the miracle to be hid and kept ſecret, (for then he would rather haue done it cloſely &amp; ſecretly, then in the preſence of a greate multitude that followed him, and woulde rather haue healed him by his will then by his worde in ſpeaking vnto him) but he commands him to tell no man, viz. before ſuch time as he had ſhewed himſelfe vnto the Prieſt, &amp; then afterward he might publiſh it and tell it to whomſoeuer he would. And this was, to auoid the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious &amp; wicked dealing of the Prieſts about the diſcerning &amp; iudging of his cleanſing: who had they vnderſtood that Chriſt had healed him, though moſt exactly &amp; moſt perfectly; yet they would neuer haue admitted nor appro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued of his cleanſing, only for the very
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:13214:86"/>malice &amp; hatred which they bare vnto Chriſt; and therefore hee would haue this to be hid, and ſecret for a while, vntil ſuch time as the Prieſt had iudged &amp; approued of his cleanſing; that if af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward they ſhould cauill and quarrell about it, they might bee conuicted &amp; condemned of themſelues, hauing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore iudged &amp; pronounced him to bee cleane. Wherin appeares moſt clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly both the ſingular wiſdome, &amp; the moſt louing care &amp; affection of Chriſt toward this Leper. His wildom in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenting and defeating the malitious practiſe of the Prieſts, by taking away al occaſion of calumniation from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; his loue and tender affection, in being carefull that the Leper whom hee had healed, might not be vexed nor mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, but be receiued again into the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety &amp; company of others. So as if Chriſtians are to follow Chriſt as ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers follow their Captaine, wee may learne both to be wiſe in preuenting &amp; avoiding of dangers, &amp; alſo to be cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable in helping &amp; deliuering ſuch as
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:13214:87"/>are oppreſſed and ſuffer iniury.</p>
            <p>For the former, our Sauiour Chriſt would haue his diſciples not only to haue the innocency of the doue;
<note place="margin">Mat. 10.16.</note> but alſo the wiſdome of the Serpent. For as religion and ciuill conuerſation do very well agree together (though ſom make all their religion to bee in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine auſterity and ruſticity) ſo alſo piety and Chriſtian policie may very well agree together. For it is not the ſimplicity of the Aſſe, which is void of all reaſon and vnderſtanding, that is commended vnto Chriſtians; but the ſimplicity of the doue ioyned with the wiſedome of the Serpent, that is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of praiſe and commendation. And therefore wee ſhall finde that the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants of God haue from time to time vſed ſingular wiſedome in all their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. It is ſaid of <hi>Iacob</hi> that hee was a plaine man (for ſo it is in our Engliſh tranſlation) and yet what wiſedome ſhewed he toward his vncle <hi>Laban</hi> in keeping his flockes, toward his wiues

            <p>But beſides this, our Sauiour Chriſt had alſo a morall regard in forbidding this Leper to tell the miracle vnto any man: which was partly in regard of modeſtie, as not caring nor deſiring to haue his good deedes to bee proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; partly in regard of humilitie, as flying all vaine-glorie in ſeeking the praiſe &amp; commendation of the world; and partly in regard of pietie, to giue al the praiſe and glory hereof vnto God, whoſe glory onely hee ſought after;

For neceſſary it is for thee to be ſeene for the imitation of others, but thou muſt not do it for this end only for the praiſe &amp; commendation of others; according as Chriſt ſayth,

            <p>But the next point, which is Chriſts humilitie, in not ſeeking for the vaine applauſe and commendation of the world, will giue vs more occaſion to ſpeake of this matter: which hee did to commend the like affection vnto vs; not to doe anie thing for vaine glory, nor for a popular applauſe, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of the world; becauſe it is not vertue, ſayth Saint <hi>Auſten,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Non virtus ſed cauſa virtutis mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedem habet. Auguſt.</note> but the cauſe of vertue that is rewarded. Our Sauiour Chriſt woulde haue vs when wee giue our almes or doe anie other good deede,
<note place="margin">Mat. 6.3</note> not to let the left hand knowe what the right hand dooth:
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Auguſt. de Temp. ſer.</hi> 59</note> that is according to Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtens</hi> interpretation, not to ſuffer the vaine glorie of the world to corrupt that which the loue of God doth or at the leaſt ought to do:
<note place="margin">

               </note> the left hand ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying a ſiniſter affection of the praiſe of men, the right hand ſignifying a
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:13214:92"/>right affection of the loue of God. So that if the deſire of praiſe and of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly glory doth inſinuate and wind it ſelf into our good deedes, the left hand is priuie to that which the right hand doth: but if wee doe them with an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt minde and a good intention, then the right hand dealeth wiſely, in doing all it ſelfe, &amp; not ſuffering the left hand to know what the right hand doth. For if any ſhall thinke that this can be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed literally, what monſtrous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits would inſue hereof? Suppoſe that the right hand bee hurt or maymed, ought not therefore a man to giue an almes with his left hand? Or ſuppoſe a man out of his charity would redeeme a Captiue, how can he either vntie his purſe, or open his cheſt, if the left hand dooth not ioine it ſelfe vnto the right hand? Therefore, the meaning of Chriſt is, that in doing our good deeds we ſhould do them with a right affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of fulfilling the will of God, and not with a ſiniſter reſpect of ſeeking the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:13214:92"/>vanity and glory of the world. Wee reade of the Prophet <hi>Eliſha,</hi> that when he wrought a miracle,
<note place="margin">2. King. 4 4</note> to do a worke of charity in helping a poore Widowe (whoſe husband being dead, the Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors came very roughly vpon hir for his debts) that hee willed her to borrowe emptie veſſells of all hir neighbours, and to goe home and ſhut the dore vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon her ſelfe, and her ſonnes, and to fill the veſſelles with that oyle which ſhee drewe out of her pitcher: ſignifying hereby (as Saint <hi>Auſten</hi> ſayes) that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man when he giues an alms or doth any good deedes,
<note place="margin">Auguſt. ibid.</note> hee ſhould doe them the dore being ſhut, that is, not to bee prayſed of men; but to finde grace and fauour with God. For, hee that dooth good deeds for the praiſe of men, hee doth them the dore being open: but he that doth them for the loue of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God, though hee doth it openly, yet he doth it the dore being ſhut, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe therein hee dooth not ſeeke that which is ſeene, <hi>viz.</hi> the praiſe of men,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:13214:93"/>but that which is not ſeene, <hi>viz.</hi> the praiſe and glory of God.</p>
            <p>To diſſwade vs from this fond deſire and loue of the praiſe of men, there can be no better motiue then to conſider, 1. How vaine. 2. How vncertaine. 3. How vnprofitable. 4.

And therefore, let vs either not regarde nor care for the praiſe &amp; applauſe of men, as making that the chiefe end &amp; marke we ayme at; or if wee doe receiue the commendation and honour of men; let it not be to admire our vertues, and to be in loue with our ſelues; but let it be to honour our profeſſion, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large Gods dominions, and to aduance the benefit and profit of our brethren, in our ſeuerall places: which is the

            <p>The which notwithſtanding is not ſo to be taken, as if wee might neuer in any caſe whatſoeuer doe any thing, whereat a weake brother may happely take offence; but that wee ought for a time to condeſcend to their infirmity and their ignorance, while they may be taught and inſtructed in the truth, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> did with the Gentiles:

<pb n="210" facs="tcp:13214:114"/>So that if after the truth ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taught &amp; demonſtrated vnto them, they ſhall ſtill remaine doubtfull and take offence; then their weakeneſſe is not any longer to bee borne withall, nor to bee nouriſhed by our diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling and yeelding vnto it; but to bee reproued &amp; corrected; becauſe now it is,

            <p>So that conſidering the great honor that God hath voutſafed to the Prieſts both of the law and of the Goſpell, it is a wonder to ſee the maruailous neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect and contempt of the prieſthood &amp; miniſterie here in the world.

<note place="margin">1.

The which commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable cuſtom, as <hi>Zanchius</hi> fayth, is now left; and after the Word preached, and the holy Supper adminiſtred, there is nothing but a beggerly caſting of ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing into the poore mans boxe: and that of the moſt for faſhion ſake, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out regarde either of a dew proportion in offering according to the meaſure which God hath giuen vnto them, or of the end for which they doe it; which

            <p>Now from hence, as from the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of <hi>Eden,</hi> which was diuided into foure heads, Gen. 2. are deriued foure propoſitions very remarkable &amp; wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of due conſideration. The firſt is, that the maintenance of Gods mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters is not a policy of men, but an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of God; due vnto them, by a diuine right, that is by the law and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of God, who hath giuen that part which hee reſerued for himſelfe, vnto his miniſters for their ſuſtentatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and maintenance. Which appeareth further not only by the lawe of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which was that they ſhould not muz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zle the mouth of the Oxe,
<note place="margin">1. Tim. 5.8.</note> that trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth out the corne (which the Apoſtle applyeth to the maintenance of Gods miniſters, 1. Tim. 5) but alſo by the law of nature and of nations, &amp; the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance &amp; approbation of Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as the ſame Apoſtle ſheweth moſt plentifully, ſaying,
<note place="margin">1. Cor. 9.7.</note> 
               <hi>Who goeth on war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:13214:130"/>at any time at his owne coſt? who planteth a vineyard &amp; eateth not of the fruit thereof? and who feedeth a flocke and eateth not of the milk of the flocke?</hi> Againe, <hi>do ye not know that they which miniſter about the holy things, eate of the things of the temple; and they which wayte at the Altar are partakers with the Altar? ſo alſo hath the Lord or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayned that they which preach the Goſpell ſhould liue of the Goſpell.</hi> The which doth plainely ſhewe, that the maintenance of miniſters is not a voluntarie and a beggerly almes gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in charitie vnto them, but an hono rable ſtipend allotted by God and due in iuſtice vnto them; according to that which Chriſt ſayth, <hi>dignus eſt operari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us mercede, the laborer is worthy of his reward.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Philo do praem. ſacerd. &amp; honoribus.</note> To which purpoſe, <hi>Philo</hi> hath verie well obſerued, that the people of the Iewes were commanded to bring their oblations into the Temple, that there the prieſts might receiue them as from the hands of God to whom they

            <p>Yea, verily, God in his wiſedome did not ſee it fitte and meete that his miniſters ſhould liue of the almes and the beneuolence of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; but rather that they ſhoulde haue a ſure and certaine mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, which by lawe and right they might clayme and challenge as due vnto them; and that for diuers waigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and important cauſes.

Secondly, to maintaine the dignitie &amp; reputation of their miniſterie, that they might not bee forced either to begge and tell their want to euerie pezant, and low priſde fellow, and to receiue a great part of their benetio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of ſcandalous &amp; notorious wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked perſons, which were not fitte for them to do; or elſe thorow pietie and modeſtie to ſuffer extreame want and penutie, which were leſſe m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<note place="margin">Euſeb. de vita Conſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.</note> but firſt of all did giue them bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full allowance out of their owne trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuries and excheckers, and afterwards gaue diuers Lands, demaynes, and poſſeſſions vnto the Church: which they did no doubt in great wiſedom; ſeeing it to bee more conuenient, both in regard of the miniſters, for the performance of their dueties, &amp; in regard of the people for their profit &amp; benefitte.</p>
            <p>The ſecond propoſitionis, that the maintenance of miniſters ought to be a liberall and a bountifull mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; foraſmuch as they had not only Cities and Suburbes allorted vnto them to dwell in;
<note place="margin">Num. 35.4.</note> but alſo the firſt fruites, and the redemption of
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:13214:132"/>the firſt borne, oblations, vowes, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices and the tenth part of all the fruits and increaſe to maintaine and to keep them withall.</p>
            <p>The truth of which doctrine is iuſtified not only by the iudiciall lawe of <hi>Moſes;</hi> but alſo by the lawe of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in <hi>Pharaoh</hi> his Prieſts, Gen. 47.
<note place="margin">Gen. 47.22.</note> who had lands and liuings belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging vnto them to maintaine them; which lands they were not forced to ſell when-as all the reſt of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſould their landes to buy them corne withall; neither would <hi>Ioſeph</hi> med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with them, but they had an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie allowance of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to liue vppon. Which is alſo fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confirmed in the newe Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: where the Apoſtle ſpeaking of miniſters ſayth, <hi>That the elders that rule well are worthie of double ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
<note place="margin">1. Tim. 5.17</note> eſpecially thoſe that labour in the word of God, and in doctrine;</hi> that is of an honeſt and a liberall ſtipend, as the Apoſtle expoundeth it in the next
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:13214:133"/>words; for it is written, <hi>Thou ſhalt not muzzle the mouth of the Oxe that trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth out the corne;</hi> as if hee ſhould ſay, the leane &amp; bare plight that miniſters are in, ſhewes plainely that their mouthes haue beene muzzled con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to the lawe; therefore ſee that you muzzle them no more, but let them eate their fill of the corne that they tread out; for <hi>the labourer is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of his meate.</hi> Wherin it is worthy the obſeruation, that the Apoſtle cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the miniſters maintenance by the name of an honour; becauſe as a baſe and a beggerly allowance maketh to the diſcredit of the miniſterie, as if the calling were baſe and contemptible and not worthy of regard: ſo a libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and a bountifull allowance ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth for the honour and countenance of the miniſterie; to ſhewe that the calling is honourable and worthie of an honourable rewarde. The like wee reade afterwarde when as the Church had Chriſtian kings and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:13214:133"/>who became nurſing Fathers, and nurſing mothers thereof, the Church was maruaylouſly inriched by the libe rall and bountifull donations of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and zealous princes &amp; others, who gaue houſes and Lands, Caſtles and Townes for the prouiſion and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of the Clergie; which conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued a long time afterwarde in many ages following, and doth yet ſtill in all well ordered Churches and Commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weales. For as <hi>Philo</hi> verſe well noteth,
<note place="margin">Philo de praem. &amp; hon. ſacerd.</note> the large and plentifull prouiſion of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing for Gods miniſters is an euident argument both of publike pietie, and of a diligent obſeruation of lawes: contrariwiſe, want and penurie, and ſcarſitie of maintenance doth vpbraid vs with contempt both of religion and of lawes; of which if there were that regard that there ought to be, the miniſters of God ſhould not only haue a neceſſary but a plentiful main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance.</p>
            <p>So then the prouiſion and the liuing
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:13214:134"/>of miniſters by the lawe of God, by the lawe of Nations, by the lawe of Chriſt, and by the lawe of Chriſtian Princes, is not a bare and beggerly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance, like vnto the Leuites wages, Iudg.
<note place="margin">Iudg. 17.10.</note> 17. which was 10 ſhekels of ſiluer, a ſuite of apparrell and his meate and drinke; the allowance which many knights and gentlemen vſe to make, who hauing gotten an Impropriati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in their hands, will hire ſome one or other for fiue poundes or twentie nobles a yeare to ſerue the cure; and (if hee were able) to teach their children too: and may I not truely ſay, the allowance of ſome rich Citizens alſo? who being poſſeſſed not only of wealth, but alſo of ſtore and plentie in great abundance; doo out of this their rich treaſure, make that allowance vnto their miniſter yeerely for his maintenance, which for verie ſhame they will not offer to one of their ſeruants for his hire, nor to a poore ſchoolemafter for
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:13214:134"/>his wages to teach their children their Abce, and to learn their letters of him. And yet (forſooth) ſome of theſe will looke to rule and ſway, and to bee great maſters and commanders in a pariſh, though their duties and allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance vnto their miniſters bee iuſt the ſame with them, that take the charitie and the almes of the pariſh. This, I ſay, is not that allowance that is due vnto Gods miniſters by the law of God and of Chriſtian Princes (whoſe godly lawes are wreſted and peruerted by the fraude and cunning of theſe kind of men) but a bountifull and an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable maintenance, hauing not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſufficiencie for neceſſarie vſe; but alſo plentie for delight and comfort too. In regard whereof, the law pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided that the firſt fruites of all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, as of corne, wine, oyle, and the pleaſant fruites of trees ſhould bee of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred vnto the Prieſts,
<note place="margin">Philo de praem. &amp; hon. ſacerd.</note> (as <hi>Philo</hi> doth ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue) to the ende that they might not liue hardly, hauing only ſo much as is
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:13214:135"/>neceſſarie to holde the body and ſoule together; but that they might liue cheerfully and comfortably, in hauing wherewith to ſolace &amp; to delite them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues withall: inſomuch that this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient author, caſting vp an account of all kinde of oblations which were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred vnto the Prieſts, ſayth, that by the lawe of God they were not much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour vnto Princes, hauing a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall tribute (as he calles it) payd vnto them as Princes haue.</p>
            <p>Therefore let no man grudge nor repine at the liuinges of mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, as if euerie thing were too much that the miniſter hath, when as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues canne bee content to poſſeſſe tenne times as much, and yet for all this, thinke that they haue not halfe inough; ſeeing that this their murmuring is not againſt Gods mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters but againſt God himſelfe,

<pb n="253" facs="tcp:13214:135"/>and charitable vſes; that ſo they might not liue hardly, but liberally; not to take an almes, but to bee able to giue almes and to relieue others. Now, ſhall men enuie and repine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them for this? GOD for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid.

So verily God will ſay to theſe enuious and maliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men; My friende, why doeſt thou grudge and repine againſt
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:13214:136"/>my ſeruants, for my bountie and large allowance that I haue giuen vnto them? Is it any wrong to thee to ſee mee liberall and beneficiall vnto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers? what if I would, to ſhewe my loue and bountie to my Apoſtles and miniſters, giue vnto them mine owne part which is due vnto my ſelfe, what is this to thee?

Goe to; <hi>tolle quod tuum eſt &amp; vade,</hi> take that which is thine own and go thy way; I haue dealt wel and bountifully with thee in giuing nine parts vnto thee, and in giuing but one part, <hi>viz.</hi> the tenth vnto them: content thy ſelfe with it, and doo not enuie nor murmure anie more, leaſt I take away the nine parts from thee, and giue the tenth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee.</p>
            <p>The third propoſition is, that the tenths and oblations with other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fittes and emoluments doo belong to
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:13214:136"/>the miniſters of God, not to any others; foraſmuch as God gaue his part to the Prieſts and Leuites for their mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; and therefore ought not to bee diuerted or conuerted to the vſe of lay men, who haue no right nor intereſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Gods tenth or in any other goods of the Church. For ſeeing that in the matter of tithes and oblatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s &amp; of all other eccleſiaſticall profits, there is a mutuall giuing and receiuing, as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.

The dignities and reuenewes of the Church do belong to ſuch as are inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by a lawful power &amp; au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority receiued fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God, to manage &amp; diſcharge the duties and offices therof,

               </note> that it doth not permitte any to reape thoſe fruites and profits which are holy vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God; but only thoſe that are of the order of the Prieſthood, though o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe hee be of the ſame Country, &amp; nobly deſcended &amp; adorned with rare and excellent vertues: whereof hee giueth this reaſon, becauſe it is not meete that ſacrifices and other cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the Altar ſhould bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Prieſts, &amp; the honours and profits to bee communicated to lay perſons; nor is it ſeemely that the Prieſts ſhould take care, and labour day and night, and the rewarde to bee beſtowed vpon thoſe that are idle and take no paines for it. Therefore to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienate or detaine the goods and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes of the Church, which are ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally due vnto God, and by a deede of gift due vnto his miniſters, cannot bee without manifeſt wrong and iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to God and to the Church: which

<pb n="270" facs="tcp:13214:144"/>buying of theſe things, to alienate his minde and his good will from them, he would out of his princely benignity prouide ſome other waies for them, as occaſion ſhould ſerue.

<pb n="271" facs="tcp:13214:144"/>people wil moue and perſwade vs; beware of this horrible ſinne of ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and take heed how you poſſeſs &amp; hold the goods of the Church; for ſo long as <hi>Achans</hi> wedge of golde &amp; the execrable thing is among vs,
<note place="margin">Ioſ. 7.13.</note> it is to bee feared that Gods iudgements, and his ſeuere puniſhments will not bee farre from vs.</p>
            <p>The fourth Propoſition is, that the tenths and oblations, with other dew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties belonging vnto God, are to bee of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred willingly and gladlie; foraſmuch as they are offered in token of our gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and thankefulneſſe to GOD: which implyeth both alacritie, and cheerefulneſſe if it bee true thankeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. And verely great reaſon there is of it: for ſeeing God dooth liberal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie and bountifullie beſtowe all that we haue, vpon vs; therefore we ought to teſtifie our thankfulneſſe by offering ſomthing moſt willingly &amp; chearefully to him again. Wherof we ſhall finde a dew and moſt deuout practice of holy
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:13214:145"/>and godly men in former times. Wee read, that when as God commaunded <hi>Moſes</hi> to builde a Tabernacle for his ſeruice,
<note place="margin">Exod. 36.5</note> the people were ſo willing and forwarde to offer euen the beſt things that they had towardes the building of it, that the workemen came to <hi>Moſes</hi> and tolde him that the people brought too much, and more then enough for the vſe of the worke: in regarde wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, he was faine to make a Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion among them, that neither man nor woman ſhould prepare any more work for the oblation of the ſanctuarie. <hi>Exo.</hi> 36.5. So likewiſe when the Temple was to be builded,
<note place="margin">1. Chron. 29 9.14</note> 
               <hi>Dauid</hi> &amp; his people did offer ſo willingly and ſo bountifully towardes the building of it, that as the text ſayth they reioyced greatly when they did it, and did thank God for their offring which they offered vnto him; acknowledging that that which they gaue, they did firſt receiue, and that of his owne hand they did giue vnto him. Of which their willingneſſe, both in
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:13214:145"/>their voluntarie oblatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, as alſo thoſe which the lawe impoſed vpon them, <hi>Philo</hi> a man of the ſame nation repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth that they brought their tribute,
<note place="margin">Philo de pram. &amp; hon. ſacerd.</note> as he calleth it, more willingly vnto the Prieſts, then in other places they did vnto Princes. For when as they payd their dueties vnto them, they would grudge and complaine of great impoſitions and exactions, and would cauill and quarrell with the publicans &amp; towle gatherers, hating them as a common plague that was ſent among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; but when as they payd theirtithes and oblations vnto the Prieſts, euerie man did it willingly and ioyfully, as if hee did not giue but receiue; giuing thankes vnto GOD, in the offring of their oblations. Yea, ſince that time, Chriſtians in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the primitiue Church, were ſo forward and willing to honor God with their goods,
<note place="margin">Act. 4.34.</note> that as many as were poſſeſſors of lands &amp; houſes ſold them and brought the price therof &amp; layd
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:13214:146"/>it downe at the Apoſtles feete; which was diſtributed to euerie one accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as he had need. And after that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, in the declining ſtate of the Church many deuout people were ſo ready &amp; forward to giue vnto the Church, that they gaue more then was thought fit in policie to bee giuen; whereupon the ſtatute of Mortmaine was made, that they ſhould not exceede certaine bounds which were limited vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Which practiſe how different it is from the practiſe of this age wherein wee liue, euerie one that is purblind may ſee: wherein the complaint and grudging of moſt men is that they are at too much coſt and charge for the ſeruice of God, as if euerie thing were too much, that is beſtowed vpon it; dealing thus worſe with God then the Iſraelites did with the golden calf: who plucked of their earings &amp; their iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els to make an Idoll; theſe contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe thinking much to doo the like for the ſeruice and worſhippe of the
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:13214:146"/>true God: Whereof none can tell ſo well as the miniſters of God, who are as it were his ſtewards and collectors to receiue his rents. When we come to demand them in our maſters name, to whom they are due, a world it is to ſee what grudging and complayning, what quarrelling and conteſting, what cauilling and diſputing there is about them; ſome pretending priuiledges and preſcriptions, others pleading cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes and compoſitions, a third ſort ſtudying and inuenting meere trickes and deuiſes thereby to defeate and to defraud God of his right; that it would grieue any well diſpoſed minde to ſee euen a very meane perſon ſo iniuriou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly and ſo fraudulently dealt withall. If hereupon in the defence of our mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters right, and in zeale to the Church, and in an honeſt care of our ſelues and ours, wee craue the benefit of the law and the helpe of the magiſtrate; Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans and towle gatherers were not more odious nor counted more coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
